# Baseball Database

This will be an application used to sort through relevant statistics for a fantasy baseball league.
The app will use Bootstrap 4 on the front end for the design and UI, while using Node.js and Express on the backend in addition to MongoDB.


## Possible Implementations
* Blog page for league members to post stuff
  * add comment sections
* add chat feature using something like socket.io so there's a chat window that can be clicked and opened.
  * make this for a group chat as well as private between members
* (maybe) create a password so only league members can enter the site
* make the database searchable so a user can enter a player name and get their stats
* make it so a user can search for players using specific stat lines:
  * for example, return players that have hit >20 homeruns


## To-do list
* organize the pitcher dbs so that the correct stats are all in one spreadsheet/db. Right now, I have two spreadsheets, one for basic stats and one for advanced stats, and for some reason they are different sizes. You'd think the number of pitchers would be the same.
